# Should I Follow

A Chrome extension that helps you make informed follow decisions by automatically scanning user profiles for your custom list of keywords.

## Why Use Should I follow?

My method for following someone is simple: I search their tweets for a few keywords. Based on what I find, I decide whether to follow them or not.

If this sounds like you, then this extension was built for you.

Should I Follow automates your personal "vibe check" on X (Twitter). Stop manually searching through timelines and let this tool instantly show you what you're looking for.

## Features

- **Automatic Profile Scanning:** The moment you visit a user's profile, the extension gets to work.
- **Clean Results Panel:** Displays only the content of matching tweets in a minimal, easy-to-read side panel.
- **Smart Highlighting:** Highlights all relevant keywords in the search results.
- **Intelligent RTL Support:** Automatically displays Persian/Arabic tweets in a right-to-left layout for perfect readability.
- **On-the-Fly Searching:** Perform new searches directly from the panel.
- **Robust & Reliable:** Uses a fallback system of multiple Nitter instances to ensure it's always working, even if one server is down.
- **Private & Secure:** Your keyword list is stored locally on your machine and is never shared.
